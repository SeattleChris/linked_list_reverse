# linked_list_reverse

Given the pointer to the head node of a linked list, change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

## Function Description

reverse has the following parameter:

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer head: a reference to the head of a list
Returns

SinglyLinkedListNode pointer: a reference to the head of the reversed list
Input Format

The first line contains an integer `t`, the number of test cases.

Each test case has the following format:

The first line contains an integer `n`, the number of elements in the linked list.
Each of the next `n` lines contains an integer, the `data` values of the elements in the linked list.

## Constraints

1 <= t <= 10
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= list[i] <= 1000, where list[i] is the ith element in the list.
